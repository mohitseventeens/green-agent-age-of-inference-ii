      "answer": "I’m João, 22, from Brasília. I speak Portuguese and a little English. I’m curious about how clean energy affects things like document storage."

      "question": "That’s great, João! To match you with the best opportunities in clean energy, could you share your highest level of education and whether you’d be open to relocating for the right role?",

      "question": "Got it! Since you’re interested in how clean energy impacts digital archives, what specific aspect of document storage or data management are you most curious about—like energy efficiency, sustainability practices, or something else?",
      "answer": "Do archivists use less paper now because of solar-powered computers? Or do they still print everything but recycle more?"

      "question": "That’s a really interesting angle! Have you thought about whether the *type* of digital storage (like cloud servers vs. local data centers) changes how much clean energy actually gets used for keeping documents safe long-term?",
      "answer": "Can blockchain store old books forever without using too much energy? I heard it’s like a digital library but... complicated."
