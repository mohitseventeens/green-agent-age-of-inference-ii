      "question": "Hello! To help you find the right green job opportunities, could you please tell me a bit about yourself? For example, your age, languages and current city in Brazil.",
      "answer": "Oh, sure! I’m Carla, 30 years old, and I live in Fortaleza. I can’t move away because of family, but I’m really into fixing things—like old bikes or friends’ appliances. It started as a hobby, but now I’d love to turn it into a stable maintenance job, maybe in a factory or production setting. Flexible hours would be great since I’ve got family responsibilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s a great foundation—especially with your hands-on skills! Did you complete any technical courses, vocational training, or formal education that could support your transition into a maintenance role?",
      "answer": "I did a *Tecnólogo* course, which helped a lot with the basics of electrical systems and maintenance. Most of my experience comes from fixing things myself—like rewiring small appliances or troubleshooting bike gears. I’m not a certified expert yet, but I learn fast and love solving problems. A job where I could grow while doing hands-on work would be perfect!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Since you’re looking for a maintenance role in Fortaleza—especially in factories or production—have you thought about which industries interest you most (like renewable energy, manufacturing, or food processing), or are you open to exploring any sector that fits your skills?",
      "answer": "I’m pretty open, but I lean toward manufacturing or food processing since those are big here in Fortaleza. My repair hobbies—like fixing motors or checking wiring—feel like a natural fit for factory maintenance. I’ve even helped a friend’s small workshop with basic machine upkeep, so I know I’d enjoy it. Flexibility in shifts is key for me, but I’m ready to adapt if the role is right!"
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s great to hear! To help narrow down opportunities, what’s your current availability for work—are you looking for full-time, part-time, or something like night/weekend shifts to balance your family responsibilities?",
      "answer": "Right now, part-time or flexible full-time would work best—maybe split shifts or evenings, since mornings are busy with family. I’ve fixed neighbors’ appliances after hours before, so I’m used to working outside the usual 9-to-5. As long as the job lets me use my hands and solve problems, I’m happy to adjust the schedule! Maintenance roles with rotating shifts could be a great fit."
