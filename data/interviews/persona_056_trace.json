      "question": "Got it! Since you mentioned your background is in hotel reception, could you tell me what level of education you’ve completed (e.g., high school, technical course, bachelor’s degree) and how many years you’ve worked in hospitality? Also, what kind of role in the green sector interests you most—even if it’s a shift from your current experience?",
