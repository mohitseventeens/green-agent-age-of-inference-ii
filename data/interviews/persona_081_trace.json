      "answer": "In my last role, I co-facilitated a series of workshops for young adults in a peripheral neighborhood of São Paulo, focusing on creative expression and local identity. The goal was to bridge gaps between different cultural backgrounds in the community. I learned how critical active listening and adaptability are—especially when balancing diverse perspectives. It reinforced my confidence in group facilitation and deepened my commitment to culturally sensitive engagement. Now, I want to bring this experience into a structured role in social/cultural action. What entry-level positions would value this kind of hands-on background?"
