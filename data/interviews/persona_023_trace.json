      "question": "Hello! To help you find the right green job opportunities, could you please tell me a bit about yourself? For example, your age, languages and current city in Brazil.",
      "answer": "I’m João Almeida, 20 years old, based in Curitiba. I speak Portuguese and English. My focus is on Fibers and Paper—I have three years of hands-on experience in product development and eco-regulations, and I’m looking for a role where I can apply that while deepening my knowledge in fiber science. My goal is a job in this field, not relocation."
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s great experience for someone your age! Did you gain your expertise in fibers and paper through formal education (like a degree or technical course), or primarily through hands-on work?",
      "answer": "I completed a graduação in a related technical field, but most of my expertise came from hands-on work in product development for paper—testing formulations, adjusting for compliance, and troubleshooting pilot runs. The combination of theory and lab time gave me a pragmatic understanding of fiber behavior and eco-regulations. My goal is to leverage this in a full-time role where I can keep refining paper products."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of companies or organizations in Curitiba (or nearby) have you worked with so far in fibers/paper—like mills, startups, or research labs—and what kind of team structures did you thrive in most?",
      "answer": "I worked at a mid-sized paper mill on the outskirts of Curitiba, supporting their product development team. The structure was lean—close collaboration between lab techs, process engineers, and compliance leads. I thrived in that environment because it balanced hands-on testing (adjusting fiber blends, running pilot trials) with direct feedback from production and regulatory teams.\n\nI also did a short project with a local packaging startup, helping them adapt their paper formulations to meet newer eco-certifications. Smaller teams suit me well—I like seeing how my work directly impacts the product. My aim now is a role in a similar setting, where I can contribute to innovation while staying grounded in the technical details. That’s why I’m targeting R&D labs or process-focused teams in Fibers & Paper."
    },
    {
      "question": "Given your preference for hands-on R&D roles and smaller teams, what specific *technical skills* or *tools* (e.g., lab equipment, software like FiberLab, or certification frameworks) do you feel most confident using—and which ones would you prioritize developing further in your next role?",
      "answer": "For lab work, I’m confident with standard pulp and paper testing equipment—like the PFI mill for refining, handsheet molders, and tensile/stiffness testers (e.g., Lorentzen & Wettre). I’ve also used basic optical microscopes for fiber morphology checks and worked with TAPPI/ISO methods for quality control. On the software side, I’ve logged data in LIMS systems and used Excel for trend analysis, though I’d like to learn more specialized tools like FiberLab or Voith’s OnQ for process optimization.\n\nFor eco-regulations, I’ve navigated FSC and EU Ecolabel frameworks—cross-checking formulations against restricted substances lists and documentation requirements. It’s an area I want to deepen, especially as sustainability standards tighten.\n\nIn my next role, I’d prioritize two things:\n1. **Advanced fiber characterization**—like using SEM for surface analysis or automated fiber analyzers (e.g., MorFi) to better predict performance in blends.\n2. **Prototyping software**—tools that bridge lab data with scalable production, so I can iterate faster between pilot runs and final specs.\n\nThese would let me contribute more directly to product innovation while keeping my hands in the technical work. The end goal is a job where I can apply this mix—developing paper products that meet both performance *and* compliance demands."
