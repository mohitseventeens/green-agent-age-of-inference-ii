      "question": "Hello! To help you find the right green job opportunities, could you please tell me a bit about yourself? For example, your age, languages and current city in Brazil.",
      "answer": "If by \"green job\" you mean environmentally focused roles, that’s not quite accurate—I’m targeting Law. To clarify: I’m 28, fluent in Portuguese (BR) and English, and based in Brasília. The \"green\" here is more about precise language in contracts, not sustainability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Got it! To better tailor legal opportunities for you in Brasília (or beyond), could you share your highest level of education, years of experience in law, and whether you’d consider relocating for the right role?",
      "answer": "I’d phrase it as \"formal legal training\" rather than \"highest education,\" since my background is Técnico—not a law degree, but focused. Two years of experience, though not strictly in Law yet. And no, relocation isn’t viable; Brasília is non-negotiable. The key is *legal writing*—contracts, specifically—where precision in wording is critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "Given your focus on legal writing and contract precision, what specific types of contracts or industries (e.g., corporate, real estate, government) are you most interested in working with here in Brasília?",
      "answer": "If by \"types of contracts\" you mean *categories of agreements*, I’d specify: commercial contracts first—supply, service, or NDAs—since their clauses demand the most rigorous interpretation. Government procurement contracts interest me too, given Brasília’s administrative focus, but the terminology there is often overly bureaucratic. The industry matters less than the *drafting challenges*—ambiguity in obligations or termination clauses, for example. That’s where my fixation on wording becomes an asset."
    },
    {
      "question": "You’ve highlighted your strength in dissecting complex clauses—have you had the chance to work with **bilingual contracts** (Portuguese/English) in your experience so far, or is that an area you’d like to develop further in Brasília’s market?",
      "answer": "I’d rephrase \"bilingual contracts\" as *cross-linguistic legal instruments*—the term \"bilingual\" undersells the jurilinguistic precision required. My experience is limited to reviewing English-portuguese translations of standard clauses, not drafting them. But it’s absolutely an area I’m targeting, especially in Brasília’s international firms or government-linked entities where misaligned terms between versions create enforceability risks. For example, \"shall\" in English versus \"deverá\" in Portuguese—subtle, but critical in obligations. That’s the kind of nuance I want to master."
