      "question": "Hello! To help you find the right green job opportunities, could you please tell me a bit about yourself? For example, your age, languages and current city in Brazil.",
      "answer": "Hello! I’m Bruna Santos, 25 years old, and I live in Recife. I speak Portuguese, and I’ve been working in retail for a few years now. What I love most is welcoming people and helping them feel comfortable—whether it’s guiding them to the right product or just listening to their needs.\n\nI’m really interested in moving into tourist reception because I think my customer service skills could be a great fit. Do you think my retail experience would help in tourism jobs?"
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s great that you’re exploring tourism! To help me suggest the best opportunities, could you share your highest level of education, how many years of experience you have in retail, and whether you’d be open to relocating within Brazil if needed?",
      "answer": "I completed my Técnico education, and I have about two years of experience in retail. I’ve enjoyed helping customers, solving problems, and making sure they leave happy—skills I think could translate well to tourism.\n\nI’m not open to relocating, though; I’d like to stay in Recife. Do you think there are good opportunities here for someone with my background? I’m especially curious about how my retail skills could apply to tourist reception roles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Have you had any direct experience—or even informal exposure—to tourism, like helping visitors in your retail job, volunteering at local events, or interacting with tourists in Recife? This could help highlight transferable skills for reception roles.",
      "answer": "In retail, I often helped tourists who came into the store—whether it was explaining products in simple terms, recommending local items they might like, or just being patient when language was a barrier. Recife gets a lot of visitors, so I’d say about 30% of my customers were tourists, especially during high season.\n\nI’ve never formally worked in tourism, but I’ve always enjoyed guiding people and making them feel welcome. Do you think that kind of experience counts when applying for tourist reception jobs? I’m also curious if I should focus more on my customer service skills or try to develop digital skills like managing online bookings. Which one matters more for starting out?"
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s a great foundation! Since you’re interested in tourist reception roles in Recife, what types of tourism businesses have you noticed thriving here—like hotels, tour operators, or cultural attractions—and which ones appeal to you the most?",
      "answer": "Recife has so many great options! I’ve noticed that boutique hotels near Boa Viagem and hostels in the historic center always seem busy, especially with international tourists. The tour operators offering city walks or trips to Porto de Galinhas also catch my eye—I love how they introduce visitors to our culture and beaches.\n\nI think I’d enjoy working in a place where I can interact directly with guests, like a hotel reception or a small tour agency. My retail experience taught me how to handle busy moments and keep customers happy, but I’m not sure if that’s enough. Should I look for roles that prioritize face-to-face service, or would it be better to start somewhere that also lets me learn digital tools? My end goal is really just to get a job in tourist reception where I can grow."
