      "question": "Hello! To help you find the right green job opportunities, could you please tell me a bit about yourself? For example, your age, languages and current city in Brazil.",
      "answer": "Hey! So, I’m André, 18 years old, and I live in São Paulo. I speak Portuguese, obviously, and some English—still learning, but I get by. I’m kinda new to this job thing, you know? Trying to figure out where to start."
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s great, André! Since you’re just starting out, could you tell me about your current education level (like high school, technical courses, etc.) and if you’d be open to moving to another city for the right opportunity?",
      "answer": "Oh, I just finished high school and I’m starting my graduação now, but no degree yet. And about moving? Nah, I’d rather stay in São Paulo—family and all, you know? I’m thinking about jobs where I can learn on the spot, maybe something with tech or... I dunno, fibers and paper? I heard there’s some cool stuff happening in that area. But I’m not sure where to begin."
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s a great mix of interests! Since you mentioned tech and fibers/paper, what kind of tasks or day-to-day work do you imagine enjoying most—like hands-on production, problem-solving with machines, or maybe something more analytical behind a computer?",
      "answer": "Hmm, good question. I kinda like the idea of hands-on stuff, like seeing how things are made, you know? But I also don’t hate math or tech—I mean, I’m okay with computers, but I don’t wanna sit all day staring at a screen.\n\nMaybe something where I can move around, learn how machines work, or even help fix stuff if it breaks? But I’m not sure if that’s more like mechanics or fibers and paper. Do those jobs even exist for beginners? Or do I need to study a bunch first?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Got it! Since you’re curious about hands-on roles in tech or fibers/paper, have you ever tried any short courses, workshops, or even YouTube tutorials on things like machinery operation, basic electronics, or sustainable materials? That could help narrow down what excites you most!",
      "answer": "Nah, I haven’t done any courses yet—just messin’ around with some DIY stuff at home, like fixing my bike or helping my uncle with small repairs. But I watch a lot of random videos, like how paper is recycled or how factories work. It’s kinda cool seeing the whole process, you know?\n\nI guess I’m just worried about jumping into something blind. Like, do I need a certificate first, or can I start as an assistant and learn while working? Maybe in a paper mill or something? I dunno if that’s even a thing here in SP."
