  "goals": "To pursue an integrated, hands-on immersion in food systems—merging pathogen mitigation, waste stream deconstruction, and regulatory arbitrage through lab-field hybrids, digital modeling (e.g., GIS, LCA software), and mentored compliance simulations. Seeks to bypass age-restricted barriers in Brasília via credential stacking (e.g., SENAI’s *Jovem Aprendiz*) and shadowing arrangements, with the ultimate aim of synthesizing a meta-curriculum that transcends fragmented industry training. Prioritizes oscillating between macroscopic systems thinking and microscopic precision (e.g., pipette-level detail) to avoid superficial dabbling.",
