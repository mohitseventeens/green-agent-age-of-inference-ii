    "**Why tokens matter for our challenge:**\n",
    "- **Cost control**: 697 job postings × 100 tokens each = 69,700 tokens to process\n",

    "- **Planning**: Models have token limits (128k for all Mistral models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick cost reality check:**\n",
    "- Small model: 69,700 tokens ≈ $0.007 to classify all jobs\n",
    "- Large model: Same task ≈ $0.14 (20x more expensive)\n",
    "- For 697 items, choosing the right model matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip**: Always start with the smallest model that can handle your task. You can always upgrade to larger models for complex reasoning later.|\n",

    "### The problem\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why traditional approaches fail\n",
    "**Regex and keyword matching** would be a nightmare here. Consider these challenges:\n",
    "- Job titles vary: \"Engenheiro de Energia Solar\" vs \"Solar Energy Engineer\" vs \"Renewable Systems Specialist\"  \n",
    "- Skills are described differently: \"2 years experience\" vs \"minimum 24 months\" vs \"experiência de 2 anos\"\n",
    "- Location formats differ: \"São Paulo, SP\" vs \"Greater São Paulo Area\" vs \"Estado de São Paulo\"\n",
    "- Requirements buried in paragraphs vs structured lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-based classification** would need hundreds of if-then statements and constant maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The LLM solution\n",
    "LLMs understand **semantic meaning**, not just keywords:\n",
    "- They recognize \"energia renovável\" and \"renewable energy\" as the same concept\n",
    "- They infer experience levels from contextual clues\n",
    "- They handle inconsistent formatting gracefully  \n",
    "- They can extract implicit information (e.g., senior-level roles often mention \"leadership\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### The trade-offs\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Much higher than regex, handles edge cases\n",
    "- **Cost**: API calls add up - need to optimize model choice\n",
    "- **Speed**: Slower than regex, but parallel processing helps\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Good with proper prompt design\n",
    "\n",
    "### This design works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Constrained outputs: Only 3 possible answers reduces hallucination\n",
    "- ✅ Clear definitions: Explicit criteria for each level\n",
    "- ✅ Simple instruction: 'Just respond with one word' forces compliance\n",
    "- ✅ Context window: 'Analyze whole file' ensures complete understanding\n",
    "- ✅ Large model default: Classification needs reasoning, not just pattern matching"
